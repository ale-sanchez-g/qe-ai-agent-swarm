McMillan Shakespeare (ASX: MMS) – DevOps & Digital Immunity Analysis

Executive Summary: McMillan Shakespeare (MMSG) is an ASX-listed financial services group whose technology strategy centers on digital customer experience and operational simplicity ￼.  Recent corporate initiatives – notably the “Simply Stronger” program – explicitly target a “superior digital experience” and technology-driven productivity gains ￼.  On the DevOps side, MMSG is building an Azure-based platform engineering capability: job postings highlight Azure DevOps pipelines, Terraform/IaC, CI/CD and platform automation ￼ ￼.  A newly formed “Common Platform” group includes DevOps, integration, RPA and a Test Automation team ￼, indicating investment in automation.  Key vendors include Microsoft/Azure (cloud and DevOps tools), ServiceNow (ITSM/SPM), OutSystems (low-code development), and Drupal expertise via partner Doghouse Agency ￼.  On the security/resilience (“digital immunity”) front, MMSG has recently achieved ISO 27001 and SOC 2 certification for its payroll/novated lease brands ￼, underscoring strong compliance.  They also cite a move to paperless processes (e.g. a “No Wet Ink” digital signature) to reduce risk ￼.  However, we found no public evidence of advanced SRE or chaos-engineering practices, and observability tool usage is unreported. Overall, MMSG appears mid-way in DevOps maturity: it has key practices (CI/CD, automated testing, cloud IaC) and a clear digital strategy, but could benefit from deeper observability, SRE-driven resilience, and next-gen automation.  Consulting opportunities include helping extend monitoring/AIOps (e.g. Datadog/Prometheus), embed SRE/error-budget practices, and advance DevSecOps in their Azure/Terraform pipelines.

Strategic Context & Digital Initiatives

MMSG operates multiple finance-related brands (Maxxia, RemServ, JustHonk etc.) and emphasizes digital self-service as a strategic priority. The company’s official communications stress making matters “simple” via technology: for example, the Future of Service initiative pledges to “reimagine customer service dynamics” and set “new benchmarks for digital self-service” ￼.  In its FY25 updates, management reports that the “Simply Stronger” transformation program is “on track” and focused on delivering a “superior digital experience” and “technology-enabled productivity” ￼.  This aligns with executive leadership: the Board’s skill matrix explicitly calls out “digital, transformation, data and technology” (including automation and AI) as core capabilities ￼.  MMSG’s C-suite includes a Chief Information Officer (Wallace Yim) driving digital transformations ￼, a Chief Digital Officer (Denise Tung) overseeing product strategy for digital channels ￼, and a Chief Transformation Officer (Anthony Vella) leading broad change initiatives ￼.

These initiatives have translated into projects like rolling out an enterprise ServiceNow platform for Strategic Portfolio Management (SPM). In practice, ServiceNow SPM was deployed to break down silos and automate demand/resource planning, replacing spreadsheet-based processes.  The ServiceNow case study notes that 100% of timesheet data entry was moved into the cloud portal, cutting entry time in half and improving project-cost visibility ￼ ￼.  In the words of the Planning and Delivery manager, this gave MMSG “a single, AI-driven cloud platform… to track project costs and make informed strategic decisions” ￼.

Beyond internal IT, MMSG has also extended digital transformation to its products.  For example, its asset-management business launched the JustHonk used-car marketplace to support a fully digital customer journey (online search, trade-in, mobile app) and dealer portal for instant quotes ￼.  The sustainability report similarly notes adoption of a “No Wet Ink” digital-signature solution to replace paper contracts in the novated leasing process ￼.  All of these moves – low-code app development, paperless workflows, omnichannel customer portals – illustrate a strong focus on automation and digital channels.

DevOps Maturity and Practices

Platform/Cloud Engineering:  MMSG is actively building an Azure-centric cloud foundation.  A recent Platform Engineer job description makes this explicit: candidates must have experience in “Windows and Azure-based corporate environment delivering DevOps, Terraform, CI, CD and Platform Engineering” ￼, and it names Azure DevOps pipelines, Terraform and Azure networking as mandatory skills ￼.  This indicates that MMSG uses Azure (IaaS/PaaS) and treats Infrastructure-as-Code (Terraform) as standard.  The platform team is expected to provision and maintain Azure resources, build “platform pipelines” for internal teams, and enforce security/governance.  In short, MMSG is adopting automated CI/CD pipelines (likely using Azure DevOps) to deliver cloud infrastructure and services.

Automation & Testing: A “Common Platform” unit has been formed that includes Integration, a Test Automation team, RPA, and microservices delivery ￼.  This suggests MMSG invests in test automation (e.g. scripted/regression testing) and Robotic Process Automation for routine tasks.  For example, the OutSystems low-code case study (prior years) noted that much regression testing was automated on the platform.  The presence of an RPA team hints at automating back-office workflows (e.g. data entry, approvals).  While details are scarce, these structures show a move toward development and operational automation.

Release Management & DevOps Culture:  Although not explicitly labeled “SRE” or “DevOps” in company communications, the job ads and projects reflect DevOps practices.  A Release and Environment Manager role on LinkedIn (not cited) also suggests formalized release processes.  MMSG’s reliance on DevOps (CI/CD) tools, Azure cloud, and rapid deployment (mobile apps in weeks ￼) indicates improving maturity.  Notably, the company has even embraced a low-code DevOps platform (OutSystems) to accelerate development: CIO Dan Giesen-White earlier remarked that OutSystems freed them “from worrying about source code” so they could focus on business requirements ￼.  (Two in-house projects – a mobile RFQ app and a web loan origination portal – were built in 3–5 months using OutSystems, replacing multi-day manual processes ￼.)  This history shows MMSG values fast, automated delivery pipelines.

Observability & Monitoring: Public information is limited. The ServiceNow case mentions AIOps capabilities, but no specific monitoring tools (e.g. Datadog/New Relic) are named.  Job ads and case studies do not reference observability frameworks.  This suggests observability is a gap: there’s no sign of enterprise-grade logging/metrics or SRE dashboards.  In practice, MMSG likely relies on Azure-native monitoring and the ServiceNow platform for alerts.  A consulting opportunity is to introduce modern observability (APM, centralized logging) and define SRE practices (SLIs/SLOs, error budgets), which are not currently visible in public sources.

Digital Immunity, Resilience & Security

Security Compliance & Engineering:  MMSG recently achieved ISO 27001 and SOC 2 certification for its payroll and novated lease businesses ￼.  The CIO, Wallace Yim, emphasized this was a “collective effort” and demonstrates that security is a shared responsibility across teams ￼.  This indicates mature security engineering and risk management processes – at least in the certified units.  The certifications imply robust controls (encryption, access policies, etc.) and third-party audits of their systems.  The stated focus is on “keeping sensitive information safe and secure” ￼, which bodes well for data protection.

Resilience & Incident Preparedness:  There is little public detail on proactive resilience testing. MMSG’s materials do not mention chaos engineering, deliberate failure injection, or formal incident drills.  The shift from spreadsheets to ServiceNow likely improved incident response (faster alerts on project overruns ￼), but traditional SRE-style practices (error budgets, fault injection) are unreported.  This appears to be an opportunity area: introducing chaos testing or robust incident simulations could enhance system resiliency.  (Consulting teams could help implement tabletop incident exercises or AIOps-driven incident prediction.)

Automated Testing:  As noted, a dedicated Test Automation team exists ￼.  Their role probably includes unit/regression test suites, possibly using tools like Azure Test Plans or similar (Azure DevOps was a requirement).  No whitepapers or blogs detail their QA stack, but the team’s presence suggests automated functional and integration tests are part of the pipeline.  MMSG could extend this by adding performance/load testing and security scanning to reinforce “digital immunity.”

Error Budgets / SLOs:  We found no mention of SLOs, SLA targets, or error budgets in any content.  While ISO 27001 covers security, reliability engineering metrics are not visible.  This signals another gap: MMSG’s systems may not formally balance velocity vs. availability using error budgets.  A consultant could help establish SLO-based processes to bring DevOps and resiliency closer together.

AI/ML and Advanced Automation

MMSG is exploring AI/ML primarily for customer channels and service management.  For example, an open job (Digital Performance Lead – Chat) explicitly requires “staying up-to-date with the latest chat AI technology” and collaborating with data science to optimize conversational UX ￼.  This shows they are building AI-driven chatbots/messaging systems for sales and support, using analytics to tune performance.  On the IT operations side, ServiceNow (SPM/ITSM) brings AI-driven workflow features into play ￼, though this is standard with the platform.  Aside from these, we saw no announcements of in-house AI/ML projects (e.g. predictive analytics or machine learning platforms).

In summary, MMSG’s AI use is tactical (chatbots, automated workflows) rather than core engineering (no mention of MLops pipelines).  This suggests an opportunity to leverage AI/ML more deeply – for example, anomaly detection on operations data, AI-assisted code quality checks, or recommender systems in their customer portals.  Given the CIO’s interest in technology trends ￼, there may be appetite for this.

Talent & Hiring Signals

Recent job ads provide clues on capabilities and priorities.  The Platform Engineer posting (late 2024) underscores the need for Azure/AWS DevOps skills ￼ ￼.  It mentions building “next generation systems” with Infrastructure-as-Code and CI/CD pipelines, indicating the in-house team is hands-on with cloud infrastructure and automation.  Similarly, listings for DevOps/Release roles on LinkedIn (e.g. Release & Environment Manager) hint at structured release management.  The Digital Performance Lead role (Sep 2024) combines digital customer experience with AI and analytics ￼, highlighting data-driven processes but not core SRE.

Collectively, these postings show MMSG is hiring both traditional technology (engineers, devops, testing) and more digital/business roles (UX, chatbots).  The emphasis on Azure DevOps/Terraform and on AI-enabled customer interfaces suggests a dual focus: robust engineering foundations and customer-facing innovation.

Gaps & Opportunities
	•	Observability & Monitoring: No public evidence of centralized monitoring or APM tools. Adopting solutions like Datadog, New Relic or Azure Monitor with log aggregation would close this gap. Consultants could audit their telemetry and implement dashboards/alerts for key services.
	•	Site Reliability Engineering: SRE practices (error budgets, blameless post-mortems) are not mentioned. Introducing an SRE culture could improve uptime. For example, setting SLOs for their core apps (leasing platforms, PlanServ, JustHonk) and measuring errors would formalize reliability goals.
	•	Chaos/Resilience Testing: Advanced practices like chaos engineering could be piloted to validate system robustness. Given MMSG’s complex services (offline-capable apps, integrated CRMs), controlled failure injection can uncover hidden weaknesses. Lack of any mention suggests consulting services in DevOps could propose a resilience testing program.
	•	DevSecOps: Although they achieved ISO and SOC2, embedding security into the CI/CD pipeline is unclear. Opportunities exist to integrate static code analysis, vulnerability scanning (e.g. Snyk or Azure Security Center) into builds. A “security by design” audit might reveal quick wins.
	•	Cloud Strategy & Cost: MMSG seems Azure-centric, but it’s unclear if multi-cloud or cloud optimization is addressed. A cloud architecture review (including CI/CD best practices, containerization strategy) could align their platform with best practices (e.g. Kubernetes governance, cloud cost controls).
	•	AI/ML in Operations: Expanding AI beyond chatbots – e.g. predictive maintenance for their asset fleets, or ML models for credit/service demand forecasting – could be explored. Data science teams already exist, so a review of data pipelines and AI opportunities would fit.
	•	Process Alignment: Consulting can help align DevOps and transformation. For instance, ensuring the Simply Stronger initiative’s tech goals (digital experience, agility) are matched by robust DevOps processes. The ServiceNow adoption shows a willingness to invest in platforms; similar momentum could drive DevOps culture improvements.

Summary of Insights: MMSG has modernized steadily: a dedicated platform/DevOps team, Azure/Terraform pipelines, a move to low-code development, and enterprise security certifications all point to significant progress. Executive leadership is strongly committed to “digital” initiatives ￼ ￼. Yet the organization seems to be in an intermediate stage of DevOps maturity. They excel at cloud automation and speed-to-market but appear to have untapped potential in observability, reliability engineering, and AI-driven operations.  Consultants could help MMSG build on this momentum by embedding DevOps best practices (SLOs, monitoring, DevSecOps), and by extending their automation culture into resilience and intelligence – closing the loop on the “digital experience” loop with robust, self-healing operations.
