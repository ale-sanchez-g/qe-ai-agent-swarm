- Collect names of executives, CIO, CTO, CISO
- Catalogue known technology partners or vendors

### Capability Inference

- Analyse job descriptions for toolchain mentions (e.g., GitHub, Terraform, Datadog)
- Review tech stack indicators using terms like ‚ÄúCI/CD‚Äù, ‚Äúplatform team‚Äù, ‚ÄúSRE‚Äù, ‚ÄúDevSecOps‚Äù
- Correlate hiring focus with internal transformation signals

### Transformation Analysis

- Search for recent press releases or analyst briefings
- Look for signs of modernisation (e.g., cloud migration, Agile transformation, engineering Dojos)
- Examine budget allocations in financial disclosures related to IT, security, cloud

## üßæ Documentation & Output Standards

- Use Markdown for research write-ups (compatible with internal repositories and client-safe exports)
- Every claim must have a source URL or reference
- Insights should be divided into:
  - Executive Summary
  - Maturity Assessment (per theme)
  - Known Initiatives
  - Gaps & Risks
  - Suggested Engagement Opportunities

## üõ† Example Structure

```markdown
# McMillan Shakespeare ‚Äì DevOps & Digital Immunity Research

## Executive Summary

## Theme 1: DevOps Maturity
- Observed use of Azure DevOps pipelines in job ads (Source: LinkedIn)
- Limited mention of platform engineering or developer enablement frameworks

## Theme 2: Digital Immunity
- Hiring for cloud security and testing roles indicates ongoing focus on resilience
- No reference to chaos engineering, error budgets, or SRE practices

## Theme 3: Tooling Ecosystem
- No known use of Datadog, LaunchDarkly, or GitHub Advanced Security
- Appears to use Azure as primary cloud platform

## Gaps & Consulting Opportunities
- Platform engineering uplift
- Observability and full-stack telemetry rollout
- Shift-left quality & security practices
