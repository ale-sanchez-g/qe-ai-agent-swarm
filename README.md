# QE-AI-Agent-Swarm

A next-generation quality engineering framework that leverages AI agent swarm intelligence to automate and enhance software testing processes.

## Project Overview

QE-AI-Agent-Swarm revolutionises software testing by combining Large Language Models (LLMs), distributed systems architecture, and swarm intelligence principles. The project aims to create an autonomous, scalable testing ecosystem that can adapt to complex applications and testing requirements with minimal human intervention.

Our development follows a progressive approach through Multiple Agent Capabilities (MAC) levels:

- **MAC1**: Monolithic agent architecture âœ…
- **MAC2**: Distributed agents with sequential execution
- **MAC3**: Full swarm intelligence with collaborative agents

## Features & Roadmap

### Test Planner
- ðŸ”„ **MAC1**: Create simple test plans from web page analysis
- ðŸ”„ **MAC2**: Generate multiple test plans based on positive/negative scenario policies
- ðŸ”„ **MAC3**: Support multiple test types (Visual, Accessibility, Security)

### Test Executor
- ðŸ”„ Implementation in progress

### Reporter
- ðŸ”„ Implementation in progress

### Defect Manager
- ðŸ”„ Implementation in progress

### Translator
- ðŸ”„ BDD to AI model flow conversion

## Technical Stack

### Core Technologies
- **Python**: Primary development language for LLM interactions
- **Playwright**: Browser automation for test execution
- **Anthropic MCP**: LLM and Tool interactions
- **React**: User interface
- **RabbitMQ**: Message broker for distributed workload management
- **Docker**: Containerization for deployment

### Database Options
- MongoDB (document store)
- PostgreSQL (relational database)
- Final decision pending

## Architecture

QE-AI-Agent-Swarm evolves through three distinct architectural phases:

1. **Monolithic (MAC1)**:
   - Single agent handling all testing responsibilities
   - Direct integration with Anthropic MCP
   - Simple workflow execution

2. **Distributed (MAC2)**:
   - Multiple specialized agents
   - Sequential test execution
   - Message-based coordination

3. **Swarm Intelligence (MAC3)**:
   - Collaborative agent networks
   - Parallel test execution
   - Emergent testing strategies
   - Self-optimizing resource allocation
