# QE-AI-Agent-Swarm

A next-generation quality engineering framework that leverages AI agent swarm intelligence to automate and enhance software testing processes.

## Project Overview

QE-AI-Agent-Swarm revolutionises software testing by combining Large Language Models (LLMs), distributed systems architecture, and swarm intelligence principles. The project aims to create an autonomous, scalable testing ecosystem that can adapt to complex applications and testing requirements with minimal human intervention.

Our development follows a progressive approach through Multiple Agent Capabilities (MAC) levels:

- **MAC1**: [Monolithic agent architecture](/monolith/README.md) âœ…
- **MAC2**: Distributed agents with sequential execution
- **MAC3**: Full swarm intelligence with collaborative agents

## Features & Roadmap

### Test Planner
- âœ… **MAC1**: Create simple test plans from web page analysis
- ðŸ”„ **MAC2**: Generate multiple test plans based on positive/negative scenario policies
- ðŸ”„ **MAC3**: Support multiple test types (Visual, Accessibility, Security)

### Test Executor
- âœ… **MAC1**: Basic test execution capabilities
- ðŸ”„ **MAC2**: Advanced scenario handling and error recovery

### Reporter
- âœ… **MAC1**: Basic test result reporting
- ðŸ”„ **MAC2**: Enhanced analytics and visualization

### Defect Manager
- âœ… **MAC1**: Defect identification and classification
- ðŸ”„ **MAC2**: Automated triage and prioritization

### Translator
- ðŸ”„ **MAC2**: BDD to AI model flow conversion
- ðŸ”„ **MAC3**: Bidirectional translation between test formats

## Technical Stack

### Core Technologies
- **Python**: Primary development language for LLM interactions and agent orchestration
- **Playwright**: Browser automation for test execution and UI interaction using [Playwright-Service](https://github.com/ale-sanchez-g/playwright-service)
- **Anthropic Claude**: LLM for reasoning and test planning through MCP

## Architecture

QE-AI-Agent-Swarm evolves through three distinct architectural phases:

1. **Monolithic (MAC1)**:
   - Single agent handling all testing responsibilities
   - Direct integration with Anthropic Claude
   - Simple workflow execution
